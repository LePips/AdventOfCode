# AdventOfCode

These are my solutions for the annual Advent of Code challenges in Swift.

TODO:
- [ ] Move setup to Plugin command
- [ ] See if setup can do everything
- [ ] Add plugin for command line run
- [ ] Add regression testing with swift-testing
- [ ] Breakout Swift utilities into a separate package
